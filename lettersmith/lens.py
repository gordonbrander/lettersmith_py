"""
A minimal implementation of Haskel-style lenses

Inspired by Elm's Focus library and Racket's Lenses library.

Lenses let you create getters and setters for complex data structures.
The combination of a getter and setter is called a lens.

Lenses can be composed to provide a way to do deep reads and deep writes
to complex data structures.
